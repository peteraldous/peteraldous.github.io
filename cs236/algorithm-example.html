<p>Consider the following algorithm:</p>

<span class="code">
<pre>
schedule([x1, x2, ..., xn]):
  if [x1, ..., xn] empty:
    return []
  else:
    select x1
    // make a list that has the elements of [x2, x3, ..., xn] that
    //   don't interfere with x1
    remaining = [xi, xj, ..., xp]
    // find the maximal schedule on noninterfering
    recur = schedule(noninterfering)
    // prepend (:) x1 to the recursive result
    return x1 : recur
</pre>
</span>

<p>With this, I think the reasoning we were doing in class is much easier. Please chew on this a bit and we'll have time on Monday or during office hours if it's not clear to you.</p>
