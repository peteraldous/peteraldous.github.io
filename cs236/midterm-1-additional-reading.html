<h1>Midterm 1 Additional Reading</h1>

<p>This page is intended to provide study material for topics covered in class but not in the textbook. The slides we reviewed in class may also be useful.</p>

<h3>First sets</h3>

<p>A symbol S's first set is the set of all terminals at the beginning of a valid derivation of S. <!--Although first sets are usually calculated for nonterminals, they can be calculated for terminals: A terminal T's first set is {T}. -->A nonterminal N's first set also contains &lambda; whenever N can reduce to &lambda;.</p>

<p>Although there is a precise algorithm for calculating first sets from grammars, it requires complications that are not necessary for the grammars in this course. Understanding the definition of first set and being able to apply it to simple grammars, such as the grammars seen in homework problems and in-class exercises will suffice. For our course, simply examine the production rules to identify possible derivations from the symbol in question and identify the terminals at the beginning of these strings.</p>

<h3>Follow sets</h3>

<p>A symbol S's follow set is the set of all terminals at the beginning of all strings that immediately follow S in some valid derivation in the grammar. Although $ is not a terminal, it is a member of the follow set of any symbol that may come last in a valid derivation from the start symbol. As such, the start symbol's follow set always contains $.</p>

<p>As with first sets, the precise algorithm is more than our course requires. Understand the definition and apply it by inspecting the grammar's production rules.</p>

<h3>Leftmost and rightmost derivations</h3>

<p>In many instances, a derivation produces strings with multiple nonterminals. For example,</p>

<blockquote>
S -&gt; AB<br />
A -&gt; a<br />
B -&gt; b
</blockquote>

<p>Two valid derivations exist for the string ab in this grammar. The leftmost derivation reduces the leftmost nonterminal first:</p>

<blockquote>
S -&gt; AB -&gt; aB -&gt; ab
</blockquote>

<p>In contrast, the rightmost derivation reduces the rightmost nonterminal first:</p>

<blockquote>
S -&gt; AB -&gt; Ab -&gt; ab
</blockquote>

<p>LL(1) parsers always produce a leftmost derivation. By extension, almost every derivation we do in our course is leftmost.</p>

<h3>Recursive descent parsing</h3>

<p>LL(1) parsers are a specific type of recursive descent parser. In our class, the most important feature of an LL(1) parser is that it is predictive; that is, it is always clear which production should be used at every stage of parsing. In the more general case, it may not always be clear which production rule is appropriate.</p>

<p>To perform a leftmost recursive descent parse on an input, try every production on the leftmost unparsed nonterminal in the parse tree. Whenever the input does not match the rule (e.g., whenever the parse tree requires one terminal and the input provides another), backtrack. It is necessary to backtrack when the parse tree is complete but input remains and when the parse tree is incomplete (and the remaining nonterminals cannot reduce to &lambda;) but input remains.</p>

<p>To show your work when performing a recursive descent parse, label each downward arrow with a number to indicate the order in which the production was applied. Indicate backtracking with upwards arrows.</p>
