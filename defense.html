<p>My dissertation defense will take place on February 24 at 4:30pm MST in room 3515 of the Merrill Engineering Building on the University of Utah Campus.</p>
<h3>Dissertation</h3>
<p>The topic of my dissertation is a novel analysis that targets Android smartphone applications. Its purpose is to prove, where possible, that information is treated safely; that is, that it does not go anywhere unsafe. For example, a user might be concerned about an app sending his or her location information to the Internet or storing it on the SD card, where other apps could see it.</p>
<p>While there is work on the topic dating back to the 1970s, none of that work succeeds in proving the absence of information flows in modern, expressive languages like Dalvik bytecode, which is part of the Android platform. This dissertation extends these previously existing analyses so that they can apply to Dalvik bytecode and other expressive languages. It also includes speed and precision metrics on an implementation of the analysis.</p>
<p>As with any dissertation, this work is highly specialized. However, I hope to present it in such a way that anyone who comes with a curious mind will be able to understand the work and leave feeling rewarded. I hope you will join us at the defense.</p>
<h3>Attending</h3>
<p>The initial portion of the defense is open to the public. If you intend to attend in person, please contact me (by phone or by email: <script>Maybe.emailme();</script>) so I can ensure that there is ample seating for everyone.</p>
<p>Some of my friends who live far away are interested in attending but unable to attend because of distance. I will stream the defense live for anyone interested in attending remotely. Check here for a link as the defense draws near.</p>
<p>Others have expressed interest in attending but are unable to attend because of scheduling conflicts. I plan to record the video stream and make it available on this website.</p>
<h3>Parking and public transportation</h3>
<p>The Merrill Engineering Building has a few paid visitor parking spots (paid via paybyphone.com) in the parking lot immediately to the north. There is also a visitor parking lot by the Union Building a short walk away.</p>
<p>For the intrepid, there is also parking to be had in the neighborhood to the north of campus. Read all signs carefully; many of the roads there have parking restrictions.</p>
<p>The final stop of the TRAX red line at the University Medical Center is a 10-minute walk from the Merrill Engineering Building. The Stadium TRAX Station, which is closer to downtown, is a 20-minute walk from the building. The 100 S North Campus Dr is a short walk from the building. To catch a return bus, cross over the street on the bridge, descend, and exit from the ground level. <a href="https://www.rideuta.com/">rideuta.com</a> has detailed information about light rail and bus schedules.</p>
