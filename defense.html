<p>My dissertation defense took place on February 24 at 4:30pm MST in room 3515 of the Merrill Engineering Building on the University of Utah Campus.</p>
<h3>Dissertation</h3>
<p>The topic of my dissertation is a novel analysis that targets Android smartphone applications. Its purpose is to prove, where possible, that information is treated safely; that is, that it does not go anywhere unsafe. For example, a user might be concerned about an app sending his or her location information to the Internet or storing it on the SD card, where other apps could see it.</p>
<p>While there is work on the topic dating back to the 1970s, none of that work succeeds in proving the absence of information flows in modern, expressive languages like Dalvik bytecode, which is part of the Android platform. This dissertation extends these previously existing analyses so that they can apply to Dalvik bytecode and other expressive languages. It also includes speed and precision metrics on an implementation of the analysis.</p>
<p>As with any dissertation, this work is highly specialized. However, I hope that my presentation will allow anyone who watches it with a curious mind to understand the work and leave feeling rewarded.</p>
